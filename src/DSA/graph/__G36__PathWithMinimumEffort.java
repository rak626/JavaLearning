/**
 * <h2>Path With Minimum Effort</h2>
 *
 * <p>
 * Given a grid of heights, find a path from the top-left cell (0,0) to the
 * bottom-right cell (n-1,m-1) such that the maximum absolute difference in
 * heights between adjacent cells along the path is minimized.
 * </p>

 * LeetCode 1631 - Path With Minimum Effort</a>
 * </p>
 *
 * <p><b>Difficulty:</b> Medium</p>
 * <p><b>Tags:</b> Graph, Dijkstra, Matrix</p>
 *
 * <h3>Approach</h3>
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Model the grid as a graph where each cell is a node.</li>
 *   <li>The cost (or "effort") to move between two adjacent cells is the
 *       absolute difference of their heights.</li>
 *   <li>We want to minimize the maximum edge cost along the path.</li>
 *   <li>Use Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm:
 *       <ul>
 *           <li>Maintain a distance matrix {@code dist[x][y]} representing
 *           the minimum effort required to reach cell (x,y).</li>
 *           <li>Use a priority queue (min-heap) to always expand the cell
 *           with the smallest current effort.</li>
 *           <li>When the destination cell is popped from the queue,
 *           its effort is the answer.</li>
 *       </ul>
 *   </li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <h3>Complexity Analysis</h3>
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Time Complexity: O(N * M * log(N * M)), since each cell may be pushed
 *       into the priority queue and each push/pop costs log(N*M).</li>
 *   <li>Space Complexity: O(N * M), for the distance matrix and priority queue.</li>
 * </ul>
