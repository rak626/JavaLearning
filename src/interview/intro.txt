 Good morning, thank you for the opportunity.
  My name is Rakesh Ghosh,
  and I have 4 years of experience in software development,
  specializing in Java, Spring Boot, and micro-services.
  I have been working at RS Software,
  where I contributed to building scalable APIs and
  developing high-performance payment application,
  mostly the payment features like Auth, Sale, Refund, and Void, recurring, installment, etc.
  also worked on integrating third-party payment brokers and gateways like tsys, worldpay etc.

   I am skilled in problem-solving, writing clean, optimized & maintainable code,
    and collaborating effectively within agile teams.

I am now looking for an opportunity where I can apply my backend development expertise
while further enhancing my knowledge in microservices and cloud technologies.
Thatâ€™s a brief introduction about me.
